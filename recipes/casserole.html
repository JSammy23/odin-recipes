          My mom made this broccoli cheese casserole every Thanksgiving when I
          was little. We kids could never get enough! If you have children or
          have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, I guarantee
          that they will eat (and enjoy) this veggie dish. It's also fabulous
          with a Christmas ham.
